CODE JAM  PROBLEM
==================
###Question###
We want to calculate the price of all the goods procured by a customer in a general store. The customer can buy any number of products which fall in categories Book, Medicine, Food. The store gives a discount of `2% on all medicines` and `4% on all the books` bought in the store. There's is another discount say `5%  given if the total bill exceeds UGX 50,000`. 

We need to come up with a price calculator which will calculate the price of the customer's shopping basket(consisting of all the products procured). 

Test cases would be as follows:

#####Input 1:#####
	5 books at UGX 2,000 each
	Medicines worth UGX 4,000
	Food worth UGX 20,000

#####Output 1:#####
	5 books - 9600	
	Medicines - 3,920
	Food - 20,000
	Total - 33,520
	discount on total - 0%
	Grand Total - 33,520

#####Input 2:#####
	5 books at UGX 4,000 each
	Medicines worth of UGX 10,000
	Food worth of UGX 30,000

#####Output 2:#####
	5 books - 19200
	Medicines - 9,800
	Food - 22,000
	Total - 51,000
	discount on total - 5%
	Grand Total - 48,450`
